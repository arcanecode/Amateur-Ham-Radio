# Amateur-Ham-Radio
This is a repository for the amateur (ham) radio presentations I do. The versions that have "with Notes" appended to the name are both the slides and the notes I use to speak from. The other version is just the slides. 

If you would like the original PowerPoint versions so you can present these at your club, just email me, n4ixt@outlook.com. The only thing I request is that I be given credit for creating this during your presentation.
